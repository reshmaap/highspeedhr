TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED REVIEW
TAR (Technology Assisted Review) assists in accelerating the review process and run analytics and generate reports.
* Core member of a team helped in developing automated review platform tool from scratch for assisting E discovery domain, this tool implements predictive coding and topic modelling by automating reviews, resulting in reduced labor costs and time spent during the lawyers review.
* Understand the end to end flow of the solution, doing research and development for classification models, predictive analysis and mining of the information present in text data. Worked on analyzing the outputs and precision monitoring for the entire tool.
* TAR assists in predictive coding, topic modelling from the evidence by following EY standards. Developed the classifier models in order to identify ""red flags"" and fraud-related issues.

Tools & Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, tfidf, word2vec, doc2vec, cosine similarity, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, LDA, NMF for topic modelling, Vader and text blob for sentiment analysis. Matplot lib, Tableau dashboard for reporting.

MULTIPLE DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTIC PROJECTS (USA CLIENTS)
TEXT ANALYTICS - MOTOR VEHICLE CUSTOMER REVIEW DATA * Received customer feedback survey data for past one year. Performed sentiment (Positive, Negative & Neutral) and time series analysis on customer comments across all 4 categories.
* Created heat map of terms by survey category based on frequency of words * Extracted Positive and Negative words across all the Survey categories and plotted Word cloud.
* Created customized tableau dashboards for effective reporting and visualizations.
CHATBOT * Developed a user friendly chatbot for one of our Products which handle simple questions about hours of operation, reservation options and so on.
* This chat bot serves entire product related questions. Giving overview of tool via QA platform and also give recommendation responses so that user question to build chain of relevant answer.
* This too has intelligence to build the pipeline of questions as per user requirement and asks the relevant /recommended questions.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Natural language processing, NLTK, spacy, topic modelling, Sentiment analysis, Word Embedding, scikit-learn, JavaScript/JQuery, SqlServer

INFORMATION GOVERNANCE
Organizations to make informed decisions about all of the information they store. The integrated Information Governance portfolio synthesizes intelligence across unstructured data sources and facilitates action to ensure organizations are best positioned to counter information risk.
* Scan data from multiple sources of formats and parse different file formats, extract Meta data information, push results for indexing elastic search and created customized, interactive dashboards using kibana.
* Preforming ROT Analysis on the data which give information of data which helps identify content that is either Redundant, Outdated, or Trivial.
* Preforming full-text search analysis on elastic search with predefined methods which can tag as (PII) personally identifiable information (social security numbers, addresses, names, etc.) which frequently targeted during cyber-attacks.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Flask, Elastic Search, Kibana

FRAUD ANALYTIC PLATFORM
Fraud Analytics and investigative platform to review all red flag cases.
â¢ FAP is a Fraud Analytics and investigative platform with inbuilt case manager and suite of Analytics for various ERP systems.
* It can be used by clients to interrogate their Accounting systems for identifying the anomalies which can be indicators of fraud by running advanced analytics

WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

â Chat Bot using AWS LEX and Tensor flow  Python
The goal of project creates a chat bot for an academic institution or university to handle queries related courses offered by that institute. The objective of this task is to reduce human efforts as well as reduce man made errors. Even by this companies handle their client 24x7. In this case companies are academic institutions and clients are participants or students.
â Web scraping using Selenium web driver   Python
The task is to scrap the data from the online messaging portal in a text format and have to find the pattern form it.
â Data Visualization and Data insights   Hadoop Eco System, Hive, PySpark, QlikSense
The goal of this project is to build a Business Solutions to a Internet Service Provider Company, like handling data which is generated per day basis, for that we have to visualize that data and find the usage pattern form it and have a generate a reports.
â Image Based Fraud Detection   Microsoft Face API, PySpark, Open CV
The main goal of project is Recognize similarity for a face to given Database images. Face recognition is the recognizing a special face from set of different faces. Face is extracted and then compared with the database Image if that Image recognized then the person already applied for loan from somewhere else and now hiding his or her identity, this is how we are going to prevent the frauds in the initial stage itself.
â Churn Analysis for Internet Service Provider   R, Python, Machine Learning, Hadoop
The objective is to identify the customer who is likely to churn in a given period of time; we have to pretend the customer giving incentive offers.
â Sentiment Analysis   Python, NLP, Apache Spark service in IBM Bluemix.
This project is highly emphasis on tweets from Twitter data were taken for mobile networks service provider to do a sentiment analysis and analyze whether the expressed opinion was positive, negative or neutral, capture the emotions of the tweets and comparative analysis.

Quantifiable Results:
â Mentored 7-12 Data Science Enthusiast each year that have all since gone on to graduate school in Data Science and Business Analytics.
â Reviewed and evaluated 20-40 Research Papers on Data Science for one of the largest Data Science Conference called Data Science Congress by Aegis School of Business Mumbai.
â Heading a solution providing organization called Data Science Delivered into Aegis school of Data Science Mumbai and managed 4-5 live projects using Data Science techniques.
â Working for some social cause with the help of Data Science for Social Goods Committee, where our team developed a product called ""Let's find a missing Child"" for helping society.
