What skills does a CAD engineer need?
CAD engineering is a very technical career that requires both hands-on work and critical thinking. CAD engineers should develop the following skills:


Business savvy: CAD engineers need to create products that are going to sell. It's useful to be able to meet with clients and learn about their goals. You may need to collaborate with them to think of ways to market a new product.


Attention to detail: Engineering is a very detail-oriented profession, so it is important to follow the company's protocol closely to ensure the safety of your team and the end-user.


Communication: Since CAD engineers often work with a team, you will need effective written and verbal communication skills to collaborate with your coworkers. Much of your communication may be through emails, so you need to be able to clearly convey your ideas and plans through text. You might also collaborate with team members in person to discuss projects.


Creativity: Creativity is essential when you are drafting new designs and models. Being able to think creatively while troubleshooting also allows you to bring a fresh perspective for improvements.


Curiosity: Curiosity can fuel your research and desire to learn more about your industry. You need to stay updated on the latest technology trends. Reading consumer and market reports can help you better understand the progress within your industry.


Decision making: When creating models, you need to have the ability to make smart design decisions. Much of what CAD engineers do depends on the wants and needs of a client, so you need to be able to determine which design choices meet those requirements.


Innovation: Creating new designs requires innovative thinking. Engineers are always finding new solutions to everyday problems and working on ways to make things look and operate more effectively.


Leadership: CAD engineers need to effectively delegate work and motivate their team of assistant drafters. Part of the job is to clearly explain new projects to team members and oversee that they complete everything on time.


Problem solving: Creating prototypes and testing them is a large part of a CAD engineer's job. If something isn't working properly, you need to be able to identify problems and find solutions to them.


Technology: Most CAD engineering involves using computer software and programs. You need to know how to use the computer to code, program, design and conduct tests. Updating and maintaining design files is crucial to saving your work, so you need to be skilled in backing up your projects.

Job Description
Electrical Engineering Technician Duties and Responsibilities
The true scope of an Electrical Engineering Technician’s job will depend upon the job they are hired for, but there are several primary responsibilities that can be applied to nearly all Electrical Engineering Technician positions. A review of current job listings identified the following core responsibilities.

1. Install Systems
When an Electrical Engineering Technician is called upon to install electrical systems to a new or existing building or to assist with creating communications or navigational equipment there is much work to be done. Electrical Engineering Technicians will need to be able to design or assist in the layout design process, order the necessary parts and equipment for the project and then either perform the installation themselves or assist in the installation process. They must ensure all circuits and parts are correctly installed and function as intended.

2. Evaluate Systems
Electrical Engineering Technicians are also hired to perform product control and system evaluations. This may require them to inspect a design plan, evaluate an electrical system and its components or actively test electronic equipment and provide recommendations or repairs. Electrical Engineering Technicians must know how to test circuits using diagnostic tools, create solutions and have the ability to complete basic repair work. Some Electrical Engineering Technicians are also hired to perform preventative maintenance to ensure the electrical systems are always up-to-date and safe.
3.Create Documentation
Electrical Engineering Technicians are expected to keep detailed documentation on all the systems and equipment they work on. They may be tasked with creating a user's manual, updating a maintenance log or providing regular reports on the tasks they have completed. The ability to create visual aids is often important for Electrical Engineering Technicians.
